class Edk2DB:
    """A SQLite3 database manager for a EDKII workspace.

    This class provides the ability to register parsers that will create / update tables in the database. This will
    create a SQLite datbase file that can be queried using any SQLite3 client. VSCode provides multiple extensions
    for viewing and interacting with the database. Queries can also be created and run in python using the sqlite3
    module that comes with python.

    Edk2DB can, and should, be used as a context manager to ensure that the database is closed properly. If
    not using as a context manager, the `db.connection.commit()` and `db.connection.close()` must be used to cleanly
    close the database.

    Attributes:
        connection (sqlite3.Connection): The connection to the database

    !!! note
        Edk2DB provides a table called `junction` that can be used to make associations between tables. It has the
        following schema: `env_id, table1, key1, table2, key2`.

    Example:
        ```python
        from edk2toollib.database.parsers import *
        table = "..."
        with Edk2DB(Path("path/to/db.db"), edk2path) as db:
