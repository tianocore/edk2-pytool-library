r"""A module for managing Edk2 file paths agnostic to OS path separators ("/" vs "\").

This module converts all windows style paths to Posix file paths internally, but will return
the OS specific path with the exception of of any function that returns an Edk2 style path,
which will always return Posix form.

class Edk2Path(object):
    """Represents edk2 file paths.

    Class that helps perform path operations within an EDK workspace.

    Attributes:
        WorkspacePath (str): Absolute path to the workspace root.
        PackagePathList (List[str]): List of absolute paths to a package.

    Attributes are initialized by the constructor and are read-only.

    !!! warning
        Edk2Path performs expensive packages path and package validation when
        instantiated. If using the same Workspace root and packages path, it is
        suggested that only a single Edk2Path instance is instantiated and
        passed to any consumers.

    There are two OS environment variables that modify the behavior of this class with
    respect to nested package checking:
        PYTOOL_TEMPORARILY_IGNORE_NESTED_EDK_PACKAGES - converts errors about nested
            packages to warnings.
        PYTOOL_IGNORE_KNOWN_BAD_NESTED_PACKAGES - contains a comma-delimited list of
            known bad packages. If a package matching a known bad package from the
            list is encountered, an info-level message will be printed and the nested
            package check will be skipped.
